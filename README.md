<h3>Posting</h3>
<p>
Post your ideas, discussion topics, fun moments, or anything else you want to share! Misskey supports text, emoji, pictures, videos, and polls!
</p>

<h3 >Reactions</h3>
<p>
Reactions are the simplest way to respond to others' posts. Simply pick a reaction emote from the list! Reactions on Misskey are much more expressive than other social media services which only allow “liking”.
</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>
Customize the UI to your own tastes! No UI will work for everyone, so Misskey is completely customizable. Make Misskey *yours* by editing the style, adjusting timeline layouts, and placing widgets.
</p>

<h3>Misskey Drive</h3>
<p>
Organize and store your files! Want to post a picture you have already uploaded? Wish you could organize your files into folders? Misskey Drive is a solution!
