With Misskey's built in drive, you get cloud storage right in your social media, where you can upload any files, make folders, and find media from posts you've made!
- **Rich Web UI**\
	Misskey has a rich and easy to use Web UI!
	It is highly customizable, from changing the layout and adding widgets to making custom themes.
	Furthermore, plugins can be created using AiScript, an original programming language.
- And much more...

<h3>Posting</h3>
<p>
Post your ideas, discussion topics, fun moments, or anything else you want to share! Misskey supports text, emoji, pictures, videos, and polls!
</p>

<h3 >Reactions</h3>
<p>
Reactions are the simplest way to respond to others' posts. Simply pick a reaction emote from the list! Reactions on Misskey are much more expressive than other social media services which only allow “liking”.
</p>

<h3>Interface</h3>
<p>
Customize the UI to your own tastes! No UI will work for everyone, so Misskey is completely customizable. Make Misskey *yours* by editing the style, adjusting timeline layouts, and placing widgets.
</p>

<h3>Misskey Drive</h3>
<p>
Organize and store your files! Want to post a picture you have already uploaded? Wish you could organize your files into folders? Misskey Drive is a solution!
